The material is a semiconductor which is ideal for tandem junction solar cell applications but is not presently stable in ambient atmosphere. We have studied the surface chemistry of the formation of oxides at the cesium titanium bromide surface and the effects of these oxides on the electronic properties. We have also cleaved the material in vacuum to study oxide free surfaces.,"<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21273&authkey=ANPgev7Wx5EtqRo&em=2"" width=""476"" height=""288"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>"
