Current studies focused on self-reports and questionnaires do not adequately control and study all factors; this emphasizes the need to identify the impacts of architectural elements instead, on the axes of the cognitive domain. To address these challenges, we designed and constructed an immersive space: a kinetic architecture installation equipped to change light, color, sound, and spatial shape. For this MQP, we utilized the space to explore the effect of light intensity on a subject while completing a puzzle by measuring physiological and neural activity.","TBD"
"82-Balaji","82","sbalaji@wpi.edu","Shravani Balaji","Shravani Balaji","Suzanne Scarlata","Biochemistry","The Role of Cavin-1 in Stress Response through the GPCR Pathway","TBD","The aim of this project is to characterize the role of the protein cavin-1 in stress response through the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. Cavin-1 is an adaptor protein that plays an integral role in the structure of caveolae, and previous studies have shown its absence in mammalian cells causes caveolae deformation. As GPCRs can localize to caveolae domains, there is a possibility that the deformation of caveolae can destabilize interactions in this signaling pathway, and lead to the formation of stress granules. Along with mechanical regulation, we explore if cavin-1 helps cells to respond to stress by transcriptional regulation, and create a model to support the data that is collected from biochemical experiments.","TBD"

NESs are sections of a protein that act as a tag and docking site for transport proteins that remove them from the nucleus. This tool incorporates an API that takes advantage of support vector machines and can be expanded to include other models. To make it useful to biochemists, a user interface that exposes options and walks the user through the process is being built. NESs can be difficult to identify by sequence, but research indicates they have consistent structure. This project aims to incorporate structural data into the model to increase confidence.","TBD"

One strategy the bacterium employs to achieve this is slowing of mRNA degradation, a process believed to be regulated by the activity of endoribonuclease E (RNase E), an essential enzyme in mycobacteria that cleaves mRNA and serves as a scaffold for other degradation related proteins to assemble. The goal of this project is to determine if mRNA cleavage sites that were previously mapped in vivo are in fact related to the activity of RNase E as postulated. This was done through in vitro mRNA degradation assays using affinity and size-exclusion purified M. smegmatis RNase E. constructs.","TBD"

"89-Honzel","89","behonzel@wpi.edu","Brooke Honzel","Brooke Honzel","Amity Manning, Jason Shohet","Biology & Biotechnology","Investigating the Role of MycN and p53 Binding in Pediatric Neuroblastoma","TBD","Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor found in children and accounts for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths. Amplification of MycN is one of the strongest indicators of poor prognosis and is present in 50% of all high-risk cases of neuroblastoma; while its role in neuroblastoma has not been clearly elucidated, evidence suggests that it binds to the C-terminal domain of p53 and alters its response to genotoxic stress. The binding of p53 and MycN is a relatively novel discovery; more investigation into the role of p53-MycN binding can provide insight into neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and potentially other MycN-amplified cancers. This project seeks to further investigate the role of MycN and p53 binding in neuroblastoma.","TBD"
"90-Perry","90","tperry@wpi.edu","Thomas Perry","Thomas Perry","Amity Manning","Biology & Biotechnology","Loss of pRb and Motility","TBD","The goal of this project is to determine whether cells with depleted pRb have a greater motility than cells with sufficient pRb. pRb acts as a master regulator of the cell cycle and has interactions with many of the other proteins in the cell. Previous research seems to have indicated that cells with a knockdown of pRb possess a higher motility, but these findings were unconfirmed. Since pRb is lost in many cancer types, a higher motility in these cells may lead to increased rates of metastasis, in which cancer cells migrate through the tissue to other locations in the body, at which point the cancer is nearly impossible to remove.","TBD"

Decellularized Aptenia cordifolia leaf grafts showed promise as scaffolds for regenerative tissues. A previous study showed xylem growth between the lamina of grafted leaves. However, those grafted leaf scaffolds did not perfuse throughout the entire graft’s vasculature. The development of fully perfusable graft is necessary to promote nutrient, gas, and waste exchange to the attached regenerative tissue. This study tested the use of mini magnets to promote the adhesion of grafted leaves during the graft incubation process.","TBD"

The goal of this project is to create a prosthetic tongue mounted on a retainer to aid in the swallowing process. This uses a series of air channels to create a wavelike motion against the roof of the mouth, which are actuated by air pumps for which we had to redesign a contraption to control and test this mechanism. For validation, this project also gathered pressure and displacement data and validates these numbers using finite element simulation.","TBD"

It displayed at several museums before reaching the Worcester Art Museum. In 2019 the statue began a renovation process. Its marble surface was treated chemically but areas of the statue had undergone major damage and several fingers and toes were broken and lost. Using molds of the existing fingers and toes, we developed a method through which laser fringes were used to create digital versions of these missing parts. We completed this process for a missing toe of the statue and 3D printed a model of the toe. We then imaged and integrated the break site of this toe into the model so it can be artistically restructured by the restorer.","TBD"

This condition consists of the loss of articular cartilage between the patella and the femur. Currently, there are no orthotic solutions to PFA. To rectify this, a knee brace was developed to lift the patella and reduce friction between the bones which would relieve the pain felt by the patient. Motion tracking data and CT images were taken of the interaction of the knee brace and a goat leg, which is analogous to the human leg, to evaluate the patellar lift. The analysis of the data seems promising and shows the need for future work such as clinical trials.","TBD"

Current practices in this industry are not sustainable due to limited resources and the rapidly increasing population. Alternative solutions need to be considered in order to sustain the growing demand for meat production. One solution is cellular agriculture, which is the process of culturing bovine muscle tissue in the lab. However, this process remains expensive, time consuming, and not scalable.

Rueda","Raymond Dunn, Raymond Page","Biomedical Engineering","Design of Improved Surgical Scalpel Handles with Optimized Grips","TBD","While technology has increased significantly in the field of medicine, the design for scalpel handle has not had any significant changes since its patent in 1914. With the current designs, aspects of surgery like safety for both the surgeon and the patient, precision, and handling are impacted due to the limited range of motion and grip. This forces surgeons to continue working on delicate procedures even if the grip is uncomfortable. Our project goal is to create improved scalpel grips using materials for reusable and disposable applications that demonstrate increased slip resistance, efficient manufacturability, improved ergonomics, and optimal haptic feedback and tactile sensation during procedures that require rotational motion.","TBD"

The current treatment often causes loss of muscle functionality, so a need exists for a therapy to promote functional muscle regeneration. Fibrin microthreads are bioinspired scaffolds shown to promote wound healing. Their properties, however need to be altered through the use of crosslinking techniques. We developed three novel methods for crosslinking fibrin microthreads using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. After conducting multiple assays, we demonstrated that HRP crosslinked fibrin microthreads had increased strengths and prolonged degradation rate while supporting cell viability.","TBD"

For this year’s team, the focus was to transition the car from 13 in. diameter wheels to 10 in. wheels, while maintaining current powertrain output and drivability of the previous car. Rationale includes reducing unsprung mass of the vehicle and transitioning to Hoosier’s LC0 tire compound; a tire compound with a theoretically better temperature range for the type of driving done in FSAE. In order to do this successfully, a new suspension system, braking system, frame, and accompanying parts needed to be designed.

LPBF currently has material limitations which restricts its use to a few industries. In order to expand the materials that can be used within these machines, experimental trials must be done. However, working with a LPBF printer outside of its material capabilities will void the warranty on a machine that could cost nearly a million dollars. We were tasked with designing and fabricating an economical LPBF prototype chamber for experimentation with various metal alloy powders and inert gases. The system will be fully customizable to allow various studies to be conducted within it.","TBD"

To do this, an active fluid is emulsified in oil and observed to see how the active fluid deforms the interface between the two fluids.

The gender of the perpetrator will be manipulated to be either male or female and stress will also be measured through a perceived stress questionnaire. We predict that people will be more willing to report against a male thief (showing leniency towards females) and that higher levels of stress will increase the likelihood of snitching as a means to stress reduction.","TBD"
