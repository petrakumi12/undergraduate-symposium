The most popular indicator that is frequently referenced in news media is the ""Yield Curve Inversion,"" which has preceded the past seven--perhaps now, eight--recessions. Using publicly available historical data from between June 1976 to September 2019, we built a predictive model using R to determine the probability of recession implied by these indicators. Our model shows a high probability of recession at the end of September 2019, and it is highly likely, if not certain that this prediction has become true, accelerated by the current global pandemic.",TBD
