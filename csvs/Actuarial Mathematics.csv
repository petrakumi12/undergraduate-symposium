The most popular indicator that is frequently referenced in news media is the ""Yield Curve Inversion,"" which has preceded the past seven--perhaps now, eight--recessions. Using publicly available historical data from between June 1976 to September 2019, we built a predictive model using R to determine the probability of recession implied by these indicators. Our model shows a high probability of recession at the end of September 2019, and it is highly likely, if not certain that this prediction has become true, accelerated by the current global pandemic.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21396&amp;authkey=AIvMRIVwmh1iU3Y&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
