This may be attributed to the lack of available data and comprehensive studies. More fundamental and applied research is required in many areas of cannabis production. Our research provides a brief overview of current recreational cannabis regulations and in depth environmental analyses of five main concerns: air, energy, pesticides, waste, and water. For each category, an evaluation of common industry practices was performed to assess their environmental impacts. Based on our research, a series of recommendations were made to improve the sustainability of the cannabis industry.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21174&amp;authkey=AGgkAwadu0vYiHA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
