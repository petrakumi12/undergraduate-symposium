In particular, our efforts focus on problems with large (&gt;1000) unique class counts, ensuring that increasing the number of sort categories does not generate scalability problems with respect to size, cycle time, cost, or other factors. This is accomplished via a two-stage hardware design which enables continuous flow of sorted components to an efficiently packaged three dimensional storage system, driven by a machine learning based classifier which prioritizes uncertainty detection in order to prevent misclassification.",TBD
