Parthenope uses perforated spinning disks through which air is directed to produce sound. Computer-control of disk speed and air flow and a variety of nozzles allow pitches to be precisely produced at different volumes. The instrument is controlled via Open Sound Control (OSC) messages sent over an ethernet connection and can interface with common Digital Audio Workstations and physical controllers. Parthenope is capable of extremely fine tuning, portamenti, rapid and precise articulation (and thus complex rhythms), and distinct timbres that result from its aerophonic character. It occupies a unique place among robotic musical instruments.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21353&amp;authkey=AO591JVp_CRjXtg&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

Reducing the downtime between prints is essential for use in mass production or when multiple users are using the same printer. Presently, an operator manually removes the print from the machine and starts a new print. In the case of a printer with a removable bed, our system removes parts by lifting the bed from the printer and feeding it through a curved track that causes the bed to bend. This bend breaks the adhesion between the part and the bed, allowing the part to fall off. The system then reverses this process and starts the next print. Print jobs are managed using a queue in OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi. Upon completion of the print, the printer pauses while the finished print is removed, and resumes printing from the queue once the bed is replaced.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21357&amp;authkey=AM7lN7rkHM4XxiA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

This would allow DraftKings to give appropriate salary values to players in a fantasy game to maximize their profits. We combined numerical and categorical data from DraftKings with data gathered from third-party sources to create a data set detailed enough to feed into our algorithms. We then utilized algorithms such as random forest regressors and neural networks to predict the fantasy points of players. The algorithms we developed outperformed DraftKings' current methodology.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21258&amp;authkey=AJt_DPKypSrthGU&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.3333333333333333"" width=""350px"" height=""286px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

Many comparable devices which are on the market are very expensive and inaccessible for many populations. A low cost, easy to use device which fits in existing incubators and is capable of remote culture monitoring was designed using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, USB camera, LED array, custom-created plastic housing, and temperature/humidity sensors. In addition to live video streaming, the device captures still images to create time-lapse videos. The device was validated by gathering data from example experiments and comparing this data to that of the gold standard.",TBD

Current tools target high level descriptions of circuits, or take days to perform analysis. We present a Sensitive HardwarE Information-Leakage Analyzer (SHEILA), the first publicly available tool-chain for estimating side-channel leakage within a design after it has been placed and routed. Through this approach we are able to assess and locate side-channel leakage across an entire device that is still in development.

This holster would restrain the gun from being removed from the holster unless unlocked with a registered fingerprint, keeping the gun safe from unauthorized use whenever in the holster. Gun owners can feel confident leaving their gun out of reach without worrying about the hassle of unlocking a safe or pulling it out of a hidden spot. This technology will keep a deadly weapon out of the hands of aggressive assailants or unaware children, and has the potential to save lives and calm the fears that millions of Americans currently share.",None
