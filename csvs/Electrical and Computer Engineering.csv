Parthenope uses perforated spinning disks through which air is directed to produce sound. Computer-control of disk speed and air flow and a variety of nozzles allow pitches to be precisely produced at different volumes. The instrument is controlled via Open Sound Control (OSC) messages sent over an ethernet connection and can interface with common Digital Audio Workstations and physical controllers. Parthenope is capable of extremely fine tuning, portamenti, rapid and precise articulation (and thus complex rhythms), and distinct timbres that result from its aerophonic character. It occupies a unique place among robotic musical instruments.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21353&amp;authkey=AO591JVp_CRjXtg&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

Reducing the downtime between prints is essential for use in mass production or when multiple users are using the same printer. Presently, an operator manually removes the print from the machine and starts a new print. In the case of a printer with a removable bed, our system removes parts by lifting the bed from the printer and feeding it through a curved track that causes the bed to bend. This bend breaks the adhesion between the part and the bed, allowing the part to fall off. The system then reverses this process and starts the next print. Print jobs are managed using a queue in OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi. Upon completion of the print, the printer pauses while the finished print is removed, and resumes printing from the queue once the bed is replaced.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21357&amp;authkey=AM7lN7rkHM4XxiA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

However, current robotic construction is limited by the types of structures robots can build and the ability for multiple robots to work collaboratively to build structures. This project aims to create an autonomous collective construction system in which multiple robots cooperate and integrate electronics into building materials to create intelligent structures. In addition, we design a multi-robot collaborative building algorithm that showcases construction both with real and simulated robots. This project is developed so as to establish both a physical and simulated framework for the future with swarm construction algorithms.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21257&authkey=ABAv7a2V6ooobHU&em=2"" width=""476"" height=""288"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>"

This would allow DraftKings to give appropriate salary values to players in a fantasy game to maximize their profits. We combined numerical and categorical data from DraftKings with data gathered from third-party sources to create a data set detailed enough to feed into our algorithms. We then utilized algorithms such as random forest regressors and neural networks to predict the fantasy points of players. The algorithms we developed outperformed DraftKings' current methodology.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21258&amp;authkey=AJt_DPKypSrthGU&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.3333333333333333"" width=""350px"" height=""286px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
