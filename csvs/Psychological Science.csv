Participants will watch a video under the guise of testing a video coding software, during which a theft of either high or low severity will be witnessed. Participants will be given multiple opportunities to report the theft. The gender of the perpetrator will be manipulated to be either male or female and stress will also be measured through a perceived stress questionnaire. We predict that people will be more willing to report against a male thief (showing leniency towards females) and that higher levels of stress will increase the likelihood of snitching as a means to stress reduction.",TBD

Students either played the game From Here to There (FH2T) (Ottmar & Landy, 2015) or solved problem sets with hints and feedback in ASSISTments (Heffernan & Heffernan, 2014), an online learning system. Our lab is aiming to understand the relationship between game-based learning systems and learning benefits.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21274&amp;authkey=ALWRS9ZwUvNXpyE&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"
