Gallium is nontoxic, sufficiently reactive, and liquid at low temperatures, ~30 degrees Celsius, making it ideal for this use. Liquid-Metal and Metal-Air batteries have some of the highest theoretical energy densities of any current battery technology; Liquid-Metal-Air batteries are predicted to have the benefits of each while counteracting the drawbacks. Theoretical calculation of a Liquid-Gallium-Air battery produces an energy density value 11 times higher than commercially available lithium ion batteries. A battery with such high energy density would help shift energy dependence away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21236&amp;authkey=AAr9191YEJJPIXA&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

The existing manufacturing process requires manual involvement for some critical activities. In this project, we developed a proof-of-concept mechatronic system that automates these activities. Multiple design concepts were generated based on the organization’s requirements. These were then compared using risk analysis, SWOT analysis, and design matrices. After a concept was selected, rigorous static and dynamic analyses and testing helped design and refine the mechatronic system. Additional testing was completed to ensure compatibility with MilliporeSigma’s current assembly process. Recommendations for scaling the design for factory use were provided.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21390&amp;authkey=ACJp28W9wxPqXQs&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

This technology will keep a deadly weapon out of the hands of aggressive assailants or unaware children, and has the potential to save lives and calm the fears that millions of Americans currently share.","<iframe src=""https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=79B772C1E1351D3E&amp;resid=79B772C1E1351D3E%21390&amp;authkey=ACJp28W9wxPqXQs&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"" width=""350px"" height=""221px"" frameborder=""0"">This is an embedded <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com"">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://office.com/webapps"">Office</a>.</iframe>"

In the case of a printer with a removable bed, our system removes parts by lifting the bed from the printer and feeding it through a curved track that causes the bed to bend. This bend breaks the adhesion between the part and the bed, allowing the part to fall off. The system then reverses this process and starts the next print.

A design concept suitable for this type of program must receive a dirty cup from a consumer and return a clean cup ready-for-use. Such a device must have washing, drying, storing, and dispensing capabilities. The design process consists of three main steps: brainstorming, analyzing, and comparing with a design matrix. The final product prioritizes compactness and simplicity of mechanical systems. It uses a carousel-like design to pre-rinse, deep cleanse, and air dry cups before dropping them into storage. Cups are dispensed using a two-step rack and pinion mechanism and reoriented for face-up consumer retrieval.
